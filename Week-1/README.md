# **CMOS INVERTER**

A CMOS inverter is a field-effect transistor that is composed of a metal gate that lies on top of an insulating layer of oxygen, which lies on top of a semiconductor. They are made up of a power supply, voltage input terminal, gate, drain, voltage output, and PMOS and NMOS that are connected to both the gate and the drain. As low voltage is applied to the voltage input, the PMOS is turned on while the NMOS remains off, allowing electrons to flow through the gate and causing the voltage output to produce a high logic. Conversely, as high voltage is applied to the voltage input, both the PMOS and NMOS are turned on, preventing as many electrons from reaching the voltage output and causing the voltage output to produce a low logic.
