# **4-Bit Full Adder**

## Logic:
We will be using the hierarchical layout concepts to build our 4-bit Full Adder, where we go from top to bottom conceptually but build the lowest level first and come upwards. The Heirarchy of a 4-bit Full Adder is shown ahead.

Stage 4: A 4-bit Full Adder consists of 4- bit full adders.Hence we need to build a Full Adder.

Stage 3: A full adder is made using 2-Half Adders and an OR gate. Hence, we need to build OR Gates and Half Adders.

Stage 2: A half adder is built using XOR gates and AND gate. An OR gate can be built using a NOR and an Invertor (Exp 1 and 2)

Stage 1: A XOR gate can be built using NAND Gates and an AND gate can be built using NAND and an Invertor (also EXP 1 amd 2)
