# **4-Bit Full Adder**

## Logic:
We will be using the hierarchical layout concepts to build our 4-bit Full Adder, where we go from top to bottom conceptually but build the lowest level first and come upwards. The Heirarchy of a 4-bit Full Adder is shown ahead.

A 4-bit Full Adder consists of 4- bit full adders.Hence we need to build a Full Adder.
